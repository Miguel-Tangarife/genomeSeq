# Preparation of the ASV tables

Total DNA was extracted from samples and the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA
gene was amplified using the guidelines given by Illumina MiSeq System (Illumina, 2013).
Amplicons of approximately 460 bp were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq platform.

Paired end raw reads were inspected for quality control and processed using DADA2
([Callahan et al., 2016][1]) in Qiime2 (version 2019.10.0), to infer true
biological sequences from reads. Forward reads were truncated at position 264
while Reverse reads were truncated at position 223 in order to discard positions
with a Phred score lower than 25.

The resulting sequences were classified using a Naive Bayes classifier
(Bokulich et al, 2018). The classifier was trained with the SILVA release 132
reference sequences and the correspondent SILVA taxonomy.
