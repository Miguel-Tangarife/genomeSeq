# Preparation of the ASV tables

Paired end raw reads were inspected for quality and processed using DADA2
([Callahan et al., 2016][1]) in Qiime2 (version 2019.10.0). Forward reads were
truncated at position 240 while Reverse reads were truncated at position 200 in
order to discard positions with a Phred score lower than 25.

The resulting sequences were classified using a Naive Bayes classifier
(Bokulich et al, 2018). The classifier was trained with the Silva release 132
reference sequences and the correspondent Silva taxonomy.
