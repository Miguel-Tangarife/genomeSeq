# Preparation of the ASV tables

Paired end raw reads were inspected for quality control and processed using DADA2 
R package ([Callahan et al., 2016][1]) in Qiime2 (version 2019.10.0), to infer true 
biological sequences from reads.  Forward reads were truncated at position 264 
while Reverse reads were truncated at position 223 in order to discard positions 
with a Phred score lower than 25. 

The resulting sequences were classified using a Naive Bayes classifier. The
classifier was trained with the Silva release 132 reference sequences and the
correspondent Silva taxonomy.
