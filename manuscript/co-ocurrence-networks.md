## Co-ocurrence networks

To produce co-ocurrence networks, ASVs with less than 10 read counts were 
removed from the ASV tables. We also removed bulk soil samples from the table 
because it is recommended to infer co-ocurrence networks using samples with 
similar microbial composition (Berry & Widder, 2014).

Co-ocurrence networks were constructed by calculating the Spearman correlation 
between pairs of ASVs.
