# Differential abundance analysis with the ASV tables

In order to compare microbial composition of soil samples associated with 
modern and ancestral plant accessions in both spermosphere and rhizosphere 
we performed a differential abundance analysis using a Zero Inflated Gaussian 
Model (Paulson et al, 2013) in the metagenomeSeq package (version 1.28.2). 
Also, we performed an ANCOM analysis in Qiime2 (version 2019.10.0). This 
analysis was performed at ASV level and also grouping those ASVs at family 
level. The same analysis was performed with OTU tables.
