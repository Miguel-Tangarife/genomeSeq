# Differential abundance analysis with the ASV tables

Differential abundance analysis was performed using a Zero Inflated Gaussian 
Model (Paulson et al, 2013) in the metagenomeSeq package. We also performed 
an ANCOM analysis in Qiime2 in order to compare microbial composition of soil 
samples associated with modern and ancestral plant accessions in both 
spermosphere and rhizosphere. This analysis was performed at ASV level and 
also grouping those ASVs at family level.
