UniFrac beta-diversity and PERMANOVA

Beta-diversity was also measured using the weighted UniFrac metric in Qiime2.

We also performed a PERMANOVA using this diversity metric in order to know
if Ancestral, Modern, Landrace or Bulk Soil samples were significantly
different in terms of microbial composition.
