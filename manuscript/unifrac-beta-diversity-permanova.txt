UniFrac beta-diversity and PERMANOVA

Beta-diversity was also measured using the weighted UniFrac metric in Qiime2.

Alternatives:
[1] We also performed a PERMANOVA using this diversity metric in order to know
/see/test the hypothesis/
if samples from Ancestral, Modern, Landrace or Bulk Soil were more similar
between them than they are to samples from other groups.

[2] We performed a PERMANOVA analysis in order to know if Ancestral, Modern,
Landrace or Bulk Soil samples had different microbial composition according to
the weighted UniFrac metric.
