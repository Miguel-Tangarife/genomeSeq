UniFrac beta-diversity and PERMANOVA

Beta-diversity was also measured using the weighted UniFrac metric in Qiime2 
(version 2019.10.0). For this purpose 16S amplicon sequences were aligned 
using the MAFFT algorithm within the Qiime2 'alignment' plugin and then we 
constructed a phylogenetic tree with FastTree (Price et al., 2010) using the 
'phylogeny' plugin.

We also performed a PERMANOVA using this diversity metric in order to know
if microbial composition of Ancentral, Modern, Landrace or Bulk Sol samples 
was significantly different.
