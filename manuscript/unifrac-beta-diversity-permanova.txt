UniFrac beta-diversity and PERMANOVA

Beta-diversity was also measured using the weighted UniFrac metric in Qiime2.
For this purpose representative sequences were aligned using the MAFFT 
algorithm and then we constructed the phylogenetic tree with FastTree (Price 
et al., 2010).

We also performed a PERMANOVA using this diversity metric in order to know
if Ancestral, Modern, Landrace or Bulk Soil samples were significantly
different in terms of microbial composition.
